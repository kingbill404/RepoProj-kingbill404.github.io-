idle hands grasp salutary change
infatuateed by the 
pixelated frames more like a cage 
made for containment .
fixation on a single page,
wilts the petals of creation,
six hexes set upon the intersectons
of time and space.
my seething dictionary divided all perseption into threes for inspection
we, left the right side, hidden behind the, hues of red blue 
the time between screens is set upon the stages to take away cosmic integration
gleaming light beams, seeing sight, not likely,
meanwhile im inside the insights within my dreams
opposing angles and deamons equally 
like qasars and distorted themes of nature
morbid scenes set upon blank paper sight unseen 
hazardly actin cautious cause of what ive seen,
its aweful im nautious just from the thoughts and memories of it
for you this will be impossible to achieve, true.

fuck the corona virus, 
you a mindless drone,
youre tuned into some bull shit.
so come rhyme with us and flow,
at the ritz.
fly high or end the riligious rhetoric.
so you do you and imma do as i wish.

my dome is about to over flow,
envisioning these outsier insites. 
its just like someone smacked ryne,
with a pipe from the inside. 
you aint never gonna make it, you a btich.
you can never reach top of ryans pile of bricks. 
that he uses to smash those revolving doors
so come rhyme with us at the ritz,
or end it.
so come rhyme with us at the ritz,
you suck dick.
so come rhyme with us at the ritz, 
some smart kids.
so come rhyme with us at the ritz, 
you a bitch.

Nothin Arrives under paitent,
Fiery Ancients. 
Wonder Why a Torn Sky is illustrious,
and Dangerous. 
might want to try and find a private entrance.
One plus or minus the square root of five,
divided by two, rooted deep in us.
Nothin Arrives under paitence,
Fiery Ancients. 
Wonder Why a Torn Sky,
is illustrious and Dangerous. 
might want to find a private entrance.
One plus or minus the square root of five,
is rooted in existance.
its Magnificent life, 
a hundred billion lives left to the finishline. 
so intence with aliveness,
im spinin' under celestial bodies. 
Bear whitness to infinetesamally small networked vibes
viruses tyson them.
we complete achievements, 
believe we eternal when every verse be reveered for indernals.
hall of fame shit
Rhymes the guy spout off by himself,
 well not really he did it with a little help 
 from Thousands of Near Perfect parallel Versions of himself.
so come and rhyme with us 3
at the ritz 3
flying bean bags infinite bliss
so come rhyme with us 
at the ritz
flying bean bags infinite bliss
so come rhyme with us 
at the ritz
you can throw fist, and stack bricks.
the the division you established with these walls
left you a tryinin handle a a nasty withrawl from all that is
had you fallin quick into the pit of egotisticl notions and cysts
flick the flame, theres magic tricsk to play
theres no skippin over these tracks, dont get it?
fist harvest some knowledge then come back wit a baseball bat
and hit the facts out of the parks, mix light with dark
add some intent and a bit of heart and you got a horror flick
cause wakin up is a nuesance 
if you dont think there is more to this
pourin bits of truth and knoweldge.
opening fourty four doors imleaving you floored
free of chRGE, FUCK COLLAGE. your  happiness is AGES away
sorry to say but all that excists
is single solitary day. this day, this moment
dont degrade your brain matter, dont slip,
dont get caught in the hallways 0dont
dont fall behind
break down those walls you spent building your whole life,
learn to utilize your whole mind,
check your bold side,
pull strings from the bottom,
keep the divine tied to your 
essence and break through all the lies
only then you miight find a heavenly scene
forever to reside in if you never try to grip time
and confide in the confines the this overheated machine.
we fly on bean bags,
De vine-rhy, ming sintax.
we shine, we real masters 
no lies, we will smack ya-third
eye to see past 
the design we all trapped in.

These rappers need Passon,
be wise so you can Grasp it.
ill be kind 'cause the whole plan first began
with eve and the devil and that damn apple  
done bestowed knowledge to man.
my god it seems odd you handed,
us the main flex on that curse, 
and im using it to ascend.

you can <b>find me</b> raising my <b>skill level</b><br />
proving the hive mind exists creating itself <br />
counsoius metal inconsed in hell we'll fall 
or else monsters concocting aweful songs<br />
Using <b>consumerism</b> our computers systems<br /> 
enduce competetive counsiousnesses<br />

tommorrows farther in the future, hardly <br /> 
embark how far you can use me, oh please<br />im seething continued,
 i'm using confusing language as tools just to end you<br />
im leveraging your already declining intensity <br />
to raise my quality of life im reclining eternilly <br />
You better <b>beware</b> and see the blairing

	youre rhymes poorly chosen,
while mine was like, 
they was composed by 
a great god in the skys 
that i just opened.
Ryline
we reach the apex and kept going 
while yall stumble,
we reproduce unlike same sex couples.
tooned in on the mike ya boy its ryan,
always crisp, but im fried.
<br />
	stumbling backwards, 
with a bottle of jack in my hand. c
roaming around just 
trying to stand being stuck in this strange land.
...	pummeling rappers.
i crack skulls in this rap game 
im humbling ametures and handing their asses 
back to em wraped in celephane.
i made that track.
now the mask is off,
now im being candid.
i'm taking acid, by the sheet. 
blasted off and never landed.
i keep it moving while you asleep 
steady camping.
keep the masses in awe
with my lyrical genius repatoir
dropping bombs on you sheeple
and i dont need no reason 
i tie my dreams into the sky 
and the morning breeze, best believe
 you have yet to see a god,

	i'm a warrior, 
amped up and going deep. [#ee]
my minds a little clever compared 
to your anaverage diety 
im a puppet but im pullling strings,
im seeing through a new eyes.
im about to be crowned your king.
but what youre seeing is (actually) 
the seed of the demon 
embedded inside of me.
..contractually.
its urban chi
cramin rhymes up in your head 
smokin these potent trees. 

freestyle shit top of the dome 
meanwhile these  
sheep sleepin back at home
crackin skulls 
packin bowls, in actuality
 im the master of reality
 attackin flows
 go like a speed boat, defeat the hopeleass
 i leave a wake of woke folks trippin alone on they matress.
i thought i told you im bat shit
crazy when im fillin in my mad libs 
strait blowing the lid off the cabinet 
im making all matter animate and 
im adamate about being above average at least

we taking far from calculated dosages,
we faded and most 'these kids couldn't cope wit this
when i take my stash out 
on the weekend i take most of it
<br />

everyone knows bill billions 
alive with the science 
a thousand years old i update myself when i climax 
my timing and brilliance both combined can, 
only be rivaled by zeus's bolts of thunder and lighning.

you know where i be, but you not sure i'm living at 
im at the ritz violating the rules, in fact 
they say he's so skilled and amazing, 
the more of them i moraly 
choose to break the more they want me back.  .. .. 
after the ashes burn down to the floor, 
find me leaving you bastards ass kissing for more
core to the center, of the human advnture i realised
that whores were the first thing our species  
sort of invented.

or see two can take up the room fast 
especiallyb if they aint using the mattress 
her eyes belie her fashion and tell when shes coming soon
Public display of love an pain 
will melt in the skies' till the end of my days  
and these mentions of fame and how rare it is 
to see its own face like two panes
reflecting its carelessness 
Keep me loving the way the disparagement keeps you insane 

 love and the pain in an endless display  

And this will be the end of my weakness

go FUCK yourself 
the reason your girl's misshapen ass left so angry
was the mitch bade emo version you showed her of your mixtape 
NObody underSTANDS constantly mentioned in  
in your hooks it's a common theme
I've got a mob of Tall blonds at the promenade they'll easily GO bra less
the REAsoning of asking Why Men LOVE HIRE ing OBjects is obvious 
the pro meat grading of yourself  U S D A choice rawdoggin for verification 
but only According to strangers and people you've known soley on facebook see
my people easily own anyone in a battle like were collenting war prisoners as slaves
my bbasement is full of rappers too basic to make a come up
yeah, patience but Will you ever be satisfied with loosing like this and being 
inveloped verbally
rhetoricle, see you're forced follow the ordinances wheather or not you know
of them is trivial
they've been commanded to serve your carnal wants and desires
'cause what better way than to literally lull you to Sheep and you buy it

cover me im going in for my interview
why you hiding under your desk.
in the office bitch we catastrophic,
taking hostages... and i will casually execute the rest of you!
a week seed bleeds syrup all up on the CARPET!
and dries the permanent magic marker on for eternity 
never fading, but getting darker

fire resting
tireslessly testing your will
satire pending in a hiarchy resigned to a deal
hightened sences sent through a compilation of wide open doors
and shattered mirrors
relations pending, mending endlessly has lost its apeal
props for the knowledge of my existence
cheers to opposing all odds 
fear not what you have been givin
thankyou for the severing thoughts
embraceing premonitions
escaltes desicions in a cascade
second rate fission
sifting thrpugh the man made
elevated depictions
this is a demolition emenating temptaion, 
ready to end this mission
take this all away and forsake this algorythm
yeah,
take back all weve gifted to you
lest not you be timid, accept nothing,expect the sum of this 
prescious timelapse to expell all symbols
rudimentary pupils, serenating the quoir
admired by a festering surplus of circuits and wires
leeches and termites
suspencefull, oh so suseptible. ozone pulls right over my spectacles
suspects inspecct the flow inject overtones to overflow 
and overthrow the prepetual hope and keep it foucused
overtones repress the votes, of hopeless people.
 for all and 
growing timid all of us we are one, in this let the moon reach the sun and sky
sirius please steer these serious notions to the sea of evolved seaman and apes 
that scene only the seems behind the mask cuz of your place, 
in society dont lie to me you know it too you a bitch 
get in a spaceship and learnt some truth 

i suspect thtat im an alien
stuck  upin a game that never end
a fucked with to many alienated aimless friends
ill make amends when i aim to mend but im phasing up
blatenly disregaurding, and discarding all of ssthem
but for now i send my regaurds to your head
did i say regaurds i meant rebarb. oh shit you dead
