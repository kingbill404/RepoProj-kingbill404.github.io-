                <p>
                    I Ride tides 'round the earth like he follows the moon when its full,<br /> Why lie I found White lies can sound wonderfull,<br /> just wisen up or get hurt by horrible truth.<br /> The splendor is endless I'd like to spend it with
                    you
                    <br /> 33 Howls from the grave to bless her reign is most the way through.<br /> you about remember bill billions forever,<br /> im the confusing genius staying richer than you,<br /> thank heaven and nature for eveything i made to
                    come true<br /> amazing that this fucking guy doesnt get it yet,<br /> if I sleep outside better believe we're having a banquet<br /> you Couldnt make it one night in the wilderness, bitch<br /> cuz the first minute of weather youre
                    dying under a blanket<br /> my boooks continuously updating the profits we automate the process<br /> when i start to drive the hard cascade of styles the Users CSharp <br /> enough to start command serving function, <br /> my Sick
                    heart grows by the gigs that im in <br /> it just like computer code or am i the grinch<br /> i thought i told you im a mixture of a angry gndalf and earcle<br /> try beeefing and learn <br /> im the m.c.-murdering-rhyme-slayer, <br />
					hooks composed of magic words,<br /> with my hieroglyph letters im casually cursing the world,<br /> nine levels of hell i already mapped the course of your doom.<br /> shine light in the darkness for you again i want three things
                    in return:<br /> keep on your toes, behold and be a whitness<br /> when my timing and brilliance both combine<br /> the illumination lights up bright enough<br /> to only be rivaled by zeus' with his bolts of thunder and lighning.<br /> 
					you know where i be but you not sure where i'm living at <br /> im at the ritz violating rules in fact ive noticed<br /> these days lately i overhear them saying<br /> he's so skilled and amazing, well, <br /> thats basically what
                    my game is<br /> pay attention to the rules i morally break, <br /> and when i choose to obey.<br /> carving the least resistant path <br /> i see the sheep want me back,<br /> i guess to heard a sheppard so easilly i was born to lead
					<br /> weather or not i choose to be is irellevant <br /> after the ashes burn down to the floor, <br /> as im leaving you bastards<br /> you're ass kissing for more i went and took a <br /> long inward journey coring to the center of
                    the human<br /> advnture a wizard told me we're<br /> all lonely consumers of pleasure<br /> im learning now and im realizing<br /> all that we've been through its simple to see<br /> why whores were the first thing our species<br /> 
					invented its answered. consumers of pleasure <br /> two can take up the rest of the room fast<br /> especially if they aint even using the mattress<br /> her eyes belie her fashion and tell when shes coming soon<br /> and faster
                    than you think a way to end the persuasion <br /> but actually its kinda like a cage or trap <br /> we just call it the pussy the past,<br /> im through with it, i alreaty lost an eye <br /> but found two in the process,tell he doctor
                    to quit it,or pay me<br /> that is unless, of course you're more awake you seem<br /> similtaniously walking the 3 paths of a warrior,<br /> other than that dont' lecture me or <br /> anyone else i keep in my family roster,<br /> becuse
                    i can tell you fora fact we read<br /> a hell of a lot more books than your library offers<br /> address your bitch as your majesty graphically,<br /> compared to your rhymes, her snaplchat posts escape gravity falls,<br /> we all
                    get it going faaster than light be going in-in a circle<br />, kinda like my writing I use that inertia to launch me<br /> out my seat and now im traveling back in time to the 90s and first thing, <br />imma see if i can watch my favorite
                    RE-runs of earcle.<br />go on the air for the first time new ones.<br />The weak type of guy is defined by <br />the reason he chooses to stay that way <br />But not ryan he’s hardly alive <br />hes died a thousand deaths<br /> 
					and He’s still getting by <br /> in spite of his terrible eyesight<br /> he sees life's divinity when he takes the stage.<br /> bought the ticket and took the ride and he's stuck in his ways <br /> in the stairs and escalators in my mind,<br /> 
					im alive channeling the ony thing i can belive ain't a lie<br /> is mine cuz each individual hads their time on this earth <br /> and then its right back to the skys and realxing, no work <br /> yeah its nice for a while untill the boredom of 
					<br /> too easily hum drum living never learning <br /> on a whim it begins to get old, <br /> expected and kinda like a want to get high so we dive<br /> back and limit your self so you can enjoy a ride <br /> then you die again. <br /><br /> 
					somethings alive in my third eye they're attacking <br /> my brain placing the old beliefs in the trunk of my space ship <br /> and im flying away Dying to say Confusion` <br /> ill leave you with several contusions<br /> 
					and your crutches rub the abrasions and wounds<br /> till the bruises pulsing black and blue and you’re fully consumed by anger<br /> <br /> Blunt force trauma like 90 mile-an-hour <br /> bottle of booze I run through the crew full of 
					losers and mutants And which one are you? <br />‘cause the truth is, the music and Mathematics<br >both fused with a emtions and bad habbits.<br /> Your impotent imagination manifests as failed creations, <br />Am I a god or just the son of satan?<br /> 
					Initiation in to hyperspace is eminent soon <br />it doesn’t matter im working every moment <br />twards us Busting out the firmament faster.<br /> <br />No i Dont need master,<br /> espacially one thans never even phathomed<br /> the 
					actual spirit has answers <br />your aura can easilly inflate and pop<br />	you sould stop, <br />those around you see your<br />soul is being woudned by mindless ventures of plasure.<br /> i'm immune to the rhetoric and pointless confusion,
					<br /> your girl told me she believes the lines full<br /> of bullshit and stupid solutions<br /> that'll never let you get ahead of it.<br /> The usual suspects are'nt always the ones using some fuses as shoestrings.<br /> All this weight 
					on my shoulders has got me Sweating profusely.<br /> I Come over showing you<br /> lessons to keep awakening this journalistic anguish<br />thats filled out on every page of my loose leaf<br /> So open your 
					eyes and let the truth speak<br /> youd think i was writing a movie <br />the way my rhymes move you in ways more entertaining<br /> than the lame vivid dreams of the life that you seek.
					<br /><br />Cant complain with that schooling you had<br /> Gimme two weeks to learn it<br /> you said but id rather nap instead<br />
					Bill Billions is up on top <br />stepping over you fools <br />for confusing the rantings and the sentiment. <br /> I grab my pen When we try to keep evil defenceless <br /> i leverage the deamons using leads that I freeed<br /> 
					from the evident breath of wilderness <br />Whats heard depends on your will so be wise and see it for what it is<br /> this is what divides the shepherd from the sheep <br />  When Pressed for Eternal time, we press on a dime<br /> 
					and arrive moving nowhere when we stepping over these lines<br /> we brighter than you can prepare prepair<br /> try not to stop we moving alive when<br /> the high tides come in.<br /> The skys vibes are raising as we radiate the
                    light within.<br /> Here to take my life back I trried once and ill try angan <br /> you clowns keep on raiding the lockers,<br /> imma slaughter her and fuck her daughter till she's<br /> walking around my house wearing my underwear
                    <br /> and shes blissuflly unaware and wondering <br /> where she can check for me supposely sentimentally. <br /> I cant help but notice you wandering behind as we hop in the ride<br /> and imma tear out of here <br />take a drive
					or a flight, might wind up <br />at the martian sky i know how you love a good scandal <br /> so come a little closer and didnt notice my hand grab the handle<br /> nice and quick like a commando around <br /> kick her out and say bye.
					<br /> then i come back rich with a tarp and a stick<br /> cuz im using it inside specifically to hold up the ritz. <br />Go back years later maybe in november reliving a needless<br /> time when im watching tv <br />pbs guy named bill nye,<br /> im getting high with him
                    at the crib<br /> and hes blowing my mind while shes blowing these guys<br />It's no woories about girlys and such its B-Killions i got billions of sperm in my nuts.<br /> litterally, come fuck me, I need more drugs<br /> so round up the
                    kids like you give a fuck<br /> figureatively cuz girl you know youre a slut. <br /> meet me in Salt Lake City utah at the church, <br /> on the back of your block. <br /> ill bust on your back, FACE and THIRD In your BUTT. <br /> Thats
                    true Fuck you, for me its something great to spoil.<br /> you can tell by the way im spillin ink on this plate amd making it boil <br /> <br />confusion,<br /> EAT to SPOILs im chillin keeping the pace with my beats <br /> 
					this is for my LATE BOTHERS we live infinate live Lives forever<br /> IVE BEEN JESUS AND a sinner while similtaniously <br /> runnning the humand race I <br />see time clearly leanring form a 4th perspective<br /> and i gotta leave the
					heard behind to fend for themselves<br /> when you heard i was leaving i had you with adain<br /> with those contusuions i was talking about<br /> in the last verse, meanwhile<br /> imma be dead cruisin around in my coffin anaware, of<br /> 
					any worries, foot on the gas and time to spare, <br /> I light a flare to the skyline 'cause im the only one there<br /> I cant bare another second on the edge,<br /> time to step,<br />	My lifes fueled by the overwhelming regret, <br /> 
					that fills my soul every time<br /> I allow myself to forget. or resent.<br /> Toiling over the lines throughout infiniate lives<br /> i believe these pointless endevors
                    <br /> i like are recently to as for me recenly i decided <br /> start tring to take my time and completion<br /><br />
                    </p>one night i was ambushed <br />by gome guys trynna scare a G,<br /> 
                    i atttacked them just fast enough to avoid seeing <br />the back of a toyota fleeing the scene <br />and hap-hazardly crashed 
                    <br />into my last usual stash spot <br />taking advantage of the distraction <br />i casually went back to the mansion <br />where everyone was supprised to see
                    <br />turns out that they set me up and <br />they didnt know I had all the cash in the attic.
