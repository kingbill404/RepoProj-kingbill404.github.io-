oh-well fuck it i hype up the memories in my skull when im reminded of bullshit, but i write about the insane times like a nuescence im tyrin the proove it and similtainiously tie up some loose ends stop trying to chain me to the grave and acting like you got a noose round my neck like it gets shorter if i dont behave stave off the opression and rage, goota get back in the book take a look at the fake age of nothin sinking its hooks. pay attention, take alook, but dont mention the foward motion that is tied to the back of the coast of a never ending ocean. your the code and im the host most cant see the cracks yo mommas back is in pain, so aimless like you a staine on my underware, your like a pair of nothing, you equal too a blank stair and i ma push you down a thousand stairs worst case scenario , there it goes;we bury those, whos stereos, dont bmp the flows of billy and ryne, g, we the chosen ones, here it it goes, turn up ya nose at me, cheap shot in the throat for free. its 333, and 22 times 27 and we just blew the hive mind open and severed ties with the devil, tryna cope with truth, too many lies but the numbers are all in perfect harmony and rhyme like the words do. fuck your immortal technique, im the more than mortal ethical version of the tempting illusive retorhic, its your uselssness that sent me to the diversion , pluscked the hairs out the excertion im fed up with this, I christened, the coillition of ambition between the soul that an exorcist will flick a flame keep the darkness lit condademn with the heart that kept beating between the measures that split these seems the light gleams so hot, it burnt these fragile wings like tey wre bitten by frost. tossin my mind around this dome , and the cold it sings, frequencies ringing in my head, like im bringin the dead to life it seems. serpants eating me alive, destroy my being and crown me a king.

    loud visions impenitribuley enter their brains 
    only then will my impeccable greatness be
    resurected its too bad the 808s werent mixed 
    right we could understand him. 
    
    youll know it when we wake up into angels 
    
    i dont know how 
    you make it so easy to sound 
    as lame and impatient as anything around in the 80s
    
    Kno-1 rivals my beats 
    in fact the crowd pays me to make them.
    
    
    you can find me regularly 
	processing M.Cs into hostages
    
    as fast as you can
  
    please believe i got a croweded baesment
    full of passionless rappers tried to get them to come up but theyre too basic 
    acknowledgments go out to me for having dreams 
    and get accomplished youre lifes too sad to laugh at 
    honestly you about as dense as a black hole 
	  crushed by a trash compactor youre words are aimless 
	  and lack provacative syntax
    just imagine the ending directed by media anchors 
    or a maticulously crafted similie between your ears 
	  and you missed it.

                  its too easy,
       	strangle your own voices.
	    you say things like you plan to vote 
        then fake it like 'my hand is broken'
        you wear a mask to hide the pain when
        thats the place you need to live 
        hurting yourself scraping your elbows running from monsters 
        after knowlege lights the room you see that all that its nonsence

compared to your rhymes, her snaplchat posts escape gravity falls,<br />
we all get it going faaster than light be going in-in a circle
, kinda like my writing I use that inertia to launch me<br />
out my seat and now im traveling back in time to the 90s and first thing,<br />
imma see if i can watch my favorite RE-runs of earcle.<br />
go on the air for the first time new ones.<br />
</p><p><br />
The weak type of guy is defined by<br />
the reason he chooses to stay that way<br /><br />
But not ryan he’s hardly alive<br />
hes died a thousand deaths<br />
and He’s still getting by<br />
in spite of his terrible eyesight<br />
he sees life's divinity when he takes the stage.<br />
bought the ticket and took the ride and he's stuck in his ways
in the stairs and escalators in my mind,<br /><br />
</p><p><br />
im alive channeling the ony thing i can belive ain't a lie<br />
is mine cuz each individual hads their time on this earth<br />
and then its right back to the skys and realxing, no work
yeah its nice for a while untill the boredom of<br />
too easily hum drum living never learning<br />
on a whim it begins to get old,<br />
expected and kinda like a want to get high so we dive<br />
back and limit your self so you can enjoy a ride<br />
then you die again.<br />
</p><p><br />
somethings alive in my third eye they're attacking<br />
my brain placing the old beliefs in the trunk of my space ship<br />
and im flying away Dying to say Confusion`<br />
ill leave you with several contusions<br />
and your crutches rub the abrasions and wounds<br />
till the bruises pulsing black and yele and you’re fully consumed by anger<br />
</p><p><br />
yelnt force trauma like 90 mile-an-hour<br />
bottle of booze I run through the crew full of losers and mutants And which one are you?
‘cause the truth is, the music and Mathematics<br />
both fused with a emtions and bad habbits.<br />
Your impotent imagination manifests as failed creations,<br />
Am I a god or just the son of satan?<br />
Initiation in to hyperspace is eminent soon<br />
it doesn’t matter im working every moment<br />
twards us Busting out the firmament faster.<br />
</p><p><br />
No i Dont need master,<br />
espacially one thans never even phathomed<br />
the actual spirit has answers<br />
your aura can easilly inflate and pop<br />
you sould stop,
those around you see your<br />
soul is being woudned by mindless ventures of plasure.<br />
i'm immune to the rhetoric and pointless confusion,<br />
your girl told me she believes the lines full<br />
of bullshit and stupid solutions<br />
that'll never let you get ahead of it.<br />
The usual suspects are'nt always the ones using some fuses as shoestrings.<br />
All this weight on my shoulders has got me Sweating profusely.<br />
</p><p><br />
I Come over showing you<br />
lessons to keep awakening this journalistic anguish<br />
thats filled out on every page of my loose leaf<br />
So open your eyes and let the truth speak<br />
youd think i was writing a movie<br />
the way my rhymes move you in ways more entertaining<br />
than the lame vivid dreams of the life that you seek.<br />
<br />
Cant complain with that schooling you had<br />
Gimme two weeks to learn it<br />
you said but id rather nap instead<br />
Bill Billions is up on top<br />
stepping over you fools<br />
for confusing the rantings and the sentiment.<br />
I grab my pen When we try to keep evil defenceless<br />
i leverage the deamons using leads that I freeed<br />
from the evident breath of wilderness<br />
</p><p><br />
Whats heard depends on your will so be wise and see it for what it is<br />
this is what divides the shepherd from the sheep
When Pressed for Eternal time, we press on a dime<br />
and arrive moving nowhere when we stepping over these lines<br /><br />
we brighter than you can prepare prepair<br />
try not to stop we moving alive when
the high tides come in.<br /><br />
The skys vibes are raising as we radiate the light within.<br />
Here to take my life back I trried once and ill try again<br />
</p><p>
you clowns keep on raiding the lockers,<br />
imma slaughter her and fuck her daughter till she's<br />
walking around my house wearing my underwear<br />
and shes blissuflly unaware and wondering<br />
where she can check for me supposely sentimentally.<br />
I cant help but notice you wandering behind as we hop in the ride<br />
and imma tear out of here<br />
take a drive or a flight, might wind up<br />
at the martian sky i know how you love a good scandal<br />
so come a little closer and didnt notice my hand grab the handle<br />
nice and quick like a commando around<br />
kick her out and say bye.<br />
</p><p><br />
then i come back rich with a tarp and a stick<br />
cuz im using it inside specifically to hold up the ritz.
Go back years later maybe in november reliving a needless<br />
time when im watching tv<br />
pbs guy named bill nye,<br />
im getting high with him at the crib<br />
and hes blowing my mind while shes blowing these guys<br />
</p><p><br />
It's no woories about girlys and such its B-Killions i got billions of sperm in my nuts.<br />
litterally, come fuck me, I need more drugs<br />
so round up the kids like you give a fuck<br />
figureatively cuz girl you know youre a slut.<br />
meet me in Salt Lake City utah at the church,<br />
on the back of your block.<br />
ill bust on your back, FACE and THIRD In your BUTT.<br />
Thats true Fuck you, for me its something great to spoil.<br />
you can tell by the way im spillin ink on this plate amd making it boil<br />
</p><p><br />
confusion,<br />
EAT to SPOILs im chillin keeping the pace with my beats<br />
this is for my LATE BOTHERS we live infinate live Lives forever<br />
IVE BEEN JESUS AND a sinner while similtaniously<br />
runnning the humand race I<br />
see time clearly leanring form a 4th perspective<br />
and i gotta leave the heard behind to fend for themselves<br />
when you heard i was leaving i had you with adain<br />
with those contusuions i was talking about<br />
in the last verse, meanwhile<br />
imma be dead cruisin around in my coffin anaware, of<br />
any worries, foot on the gas and time to spare,<br />
I light a flare to the skyline 'cause im the only one there<br />
I cant bare another second on the edge,<br />
time to step,<br />
My lifes fueled by the overwhelming regret,<br />
that fills my soul every time<br />
I allow myself to forget. or resent.<br />
Toiling over the lines throughout infiniate lives<br />
i believe these pointless endevors<br />
i like are recently to as for me recenly i decided<br />
start tring to take my time and completion<br />
</p><p>
one night i was ambushed<br />
by gome guys trynna scare a G,<br />
i atttacked them just fast enough to avoid seeing<br />
the back of a toyota fleeing the scene<br />
and hap-hazardly crashed<br />
into my last usual stash spot<br />
taking advantage of the distraction<br />
i casually went back to the mansion<br />
where everyone was supprised to see<br />
turns out that they set me up and<br />
they didnt know I had all the cash in the attic.<br />
