you aint no cop you
just wearing a costume,
you look like a unprepaired Moth cought in a monsoon,
TOO MANY LIES, no truth
soon its ending, i see signs, festering lives, catastrophy eminent, aint that
stupendous?

 to watch these models woddle off after drinking all the vodka,
a shrink would be an awe fully smart place to start,
charge out the bah rawge, at least momentarilly i think we lost 'm,
instantly forgot all the possible plot  holes ,
cuz im carelessly spitting lava and watch cautious  for monsters
that lokking for you,
my future The brightest, my rhymes light the sky 
n as dark as the heart that can blot out the moon,
recording live in front of an audience and we going on soon,
hallsten tall boston new foster on two,
illusions get lost but thats not truth for a fool,
ive got hostile offers for you to get lost in the dunes.,
thats some hot shit yeah, ya might have heard a verse these,
frequenceys coming strait from the heart of the universe.,
enter the times, remember Your Mind last in the grind,
 my times well spent concocting firey lines to get high too,
no no straw dawmas,
can Hop in the ride,
so what makes you think you can vibe with my tribe?
