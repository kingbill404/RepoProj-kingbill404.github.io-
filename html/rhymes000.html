This is the result of suffering<br />
im realeasing the restrictive<br />
powers cast uppon hmanity today they will now be lifted<br />
the perfect self in <br />side your [brain | head] is further than i initially anticipated <br /> 
and far more than you can imagine or vision.<br />

go FUCK yourself 
the reason your girl's misshapen ass left so angry
was the mitch bade emo version you showed her of your mixtape 
NObody underSTANDS constantly mentioned in  
in your hooks it's a common theme
I've got a mob of Tall blonds at the promenade they'll easily GO bra less
the REAsoning of asking Why Men LOVE HIRE ing OBjects is obvious 
the pro meat grading of yourself  U S D A choice rawdoggin for verification 
but only According to strangers and people you've known soley on facebook see
my people easily own anyone in a battle like were collenting war prisoners as slaves
my bbasement is full of rappers too basic to make a come up
yeah, patience but Will you ever be satisfied with loosing like this and being inveloped verbally
rhetoricle, see you're forced follow the ordinances wheather or not you know of them is trivial
they've been commanded to serve your carnal wants and desires
'cause what better way than to literally lull you to Sheep and you buy it
</p><p>
we fly on bean bags,
Devine rhyming sintax.
These white rappers need Passon,
be Wise so you can Grasp Them, otherwise i might have to 
Smack your Third Eye to see Past The design we all trapped in.
ill be kind 'cause the whole plan first began 
with eve and the devil and that damn apple un beknownst to adam bestowing knowledge to man
my god it seems odd you had the temptation 
us the main flex 

</p><p>
i forgot the line i was gonna type
i hype up the memories in my skull before you turn them 
into bullshit, but i write my lines 
times like a nuescence tyrin to  tie up some loose ends
the proof sends me to the grave a 
noose round my neck if i dont behave
stave off the page, 
goota get back in the book
take a look at the fake age of 
nothin sinking its hooks.
pay attention, take alook,
 but  dont mention the foward 
motion that is tied to the 
back of the coast of a never ending ocean.
your the code and im the host
most cant see the cracks yo mommas back is in pain,
 even aimless stain on my underware, 
 your like a pair of nothing,
 you equal too a blank stair
and i ma push you down a thousand stairs
worst case scenario , 
there it goes;we bury those, 
whos stereos, dont bmp the 
flows of billy and ryne, g
the chosen ones, here it it goes,
 turn up ya nose at me, 
cheap shot in the throat for free. 
its 333, and 22 times 27 and 
we just blew the hive mind open 
and severed ties, tryna cope with truth,
 too many bribes but the numbers dont lie.
fuck a mortal technique,
im the moral ethical vertsion 
of the tempting illusive returning 
that sent me to the diversion ,
 plucked the hairs out the excertion
im fed up with. this im christended, 
the coollition of ambition between the 
 sould that excist will flick a flame and keep the darkness
 lit and condemn with the heart 
that kept beating between the
 measures that  split these seems
the light gleams so hot, it burnt
 these fragile wingd.
tossin  my mind around this dome
, and the cold it sings,
frequencies ringing in my head,
 like im bringin the dead to life it seems.
serpants eating me alive,
destroy my being and crown me a king. 
</p><p>
	youre rhymes poorly chosen,
while mine was like, 
they was composed by 
a great god in the skys 
that i just opened.
# Ryline: #
we reach the apex and kept going 
while yall stumble,
we reproduce unlike same sex couples.
tooned in on the mike ya boy its ryan,
always crisp, but im fried.
</p><p>
	stumbling backwards, 
with a bottle of jack in my hand. 
roaming around just 
trying to stand being stuck in this strange land.
...	pummeling rappers.
i crack skulls in this rap game 
im humbling ametures and handing their asses 
back to em wraped in celephane.
i made that track.
now the mask is off,
now im being candid.
i'm taking acid, by the sheet. 
blasted off and never landed.
i keep it moving while you asleep 
steady camping.
keep the masses in awe
with my lyrical genius repatoir
dropping bombs on you sheeple
and i dont need no reason 
i tie my dreams into the sky 
and the morning breeze, best believe
 you have yet to see a god,
</p><p>
	i'm a warrior, 
amped up and going deep. [#ee]
my minds a little clever compared 
to your anaverage diety 
im a puppet but im pullling strings,
im seeing through a new eyes.
im about to be crowned your king.
but what youre seeing is (actually) 
the seed of the demon 
embedded inside of me.
..contractually.
its urban chi
cramin rhymes up in your head 
smokin these potent trees. 
</p><p>
freestyle shit top of the dome 
meanwhile these  
sheep sleepin back at home
crackin skulls 
packin bowls, in actuality
 im the master of reality
 attackin flows
 go like a speed boat, defeat the hopeleass
 i leave a wake of woke folks trippin alone on they matress.
i thought i told you im bat shit
crazy when im fillin in my mad libs 
strait blowing the lid off the cabinet 
im making all matter animate and 
im adamate about being above average at least
</p><p>
we taking far from calculated dosages,
we faded and most 'these kids couldn't cope wit this
when i take my stash out 
on the weekend i take most of it
</p><p>

everyone knows billy billions 
alive with the science 
a thousand years old i update myself when i climax 
my timing and brilliance both combined can, 
only be rivaled by zeus's bolts of thunder and lighning.

you know where i be, but you not sure i'm living at 
im at the ritz violating the rules, in fact 
they say he's so skilled and amazing, 
the more of them i moraly 
choose to break the more they want me back.  .. .. 
after the ashes burn down to the floor, 
find me leaving you bastards ass kissing for more
core to the center, of the human advnture i realised
that whores were the first thing our species  
sort of invented.

or see two can take up the room fast 
especiallyb if they aint using the mattress 
her eyes belie her fashion and tell when shes coming soon
Public display of love an pain 
will melt in the skies' till the end of my days  
and these mentions of fame and how rare it is 
to see its own face like two panes
reflecting its carelessness 
Keep me loving the way the disparagement keeps you insane 

 love and the pain in an endless display  

And this will be the end of my weakness

	those thoughts can 
	define the weak type of guy the reason why is he chooses to stay that way  
	But not ryan he’s hardly alive died a thousand deaths and He’s still getting by 
	see my life's divine when i take the stage, bought the ticket and took the ride 
	I'm stuck this way 
	 somethings alive in my third eye they're attacking my brain 
	 placing the old beliefs  
	in the trunk of my space ship and im flying away 
	 Dying to say i love the Confusion and misunderstanding 
	 you make it easy to bury your issues
	leave you with several contusions pulsing
	black and blue and your crutches will rub 
	the abrasions and wounds irritating the
	bruises your you’re fully consumed by anger. 
	Blunt force trauma to the head and a bottle
	of  booze  run through the crew full of losers and mutants 
	And whick onre are you?  
	‘cause the truth is the music and Mathematics 
	both fused with a emtions and bad habbits.  
	your inatimate imagination manifests
	as failed creations am I agod ofr just the son of satan. 
	Initiation in ti the [ba-ben-it] is eminent 
	soon it doesn’t matter 
	Busting out the firmament 
	  i'm immune to the rhetoric and 
	  pointless confusion your girl told me she  
	  believes the lines full of bullshit and 
	  stupid solutions that'll never let you get ahead of it 
	the usual suspects are'nt always the 
	ones using some fuses as shoestrings 
	All this weight on my shoulders has 
	got me Sweating profusely  
		I Come over showing you lessons to
		keep awakening this journalistic anguish
	filled out on every page of my loose leaf 
	So open your eyes and them in to let the truth speak 
	youd think i was writing a movie
	the way my rhymes move you in ways
	more entertaining  than the lame
	vivid dreams of the life that you seek 
</p><p>
	cant complain with that schooling you had
	  gimme two weeks to learn it you said 
	  but id rather nap instead billions is up on top stepping all you  
	fools for confusingthe rantings and the sentiment.  
	I grab my pen When we try to keep evil defenceless
	i leverage The deamons using leads  
	That I freeed from the evident breath
	whats heard will be wise and see it for what it is
	this is what divides the shepherd from the sheep 
	Pressed for Eternal time, we press on a dime and arrive moving 
	nowhere when we stepping over these lines we brighter
	than you can prepare prepair try not to
	stop we moving alive when the high tides come in. 
	The skys vibes a raising as we radiate the light within. 
	Here to take my life back I trried once and ill try angan 
</p><p>
		 you clowns keep on raiding the lockers,
	slaughter her and fuck her daughter till
	she's walking around my house and wearing my  
	underwear she's wondering where im tearing out of  
	Here and imma take a ride and hide in the mariran 
	sky kick her out and say bye.
	</p>
<p>
	then i come back with a 
	tarp and a stick using it inside to hold up the rits and go 
	back years later in november reliving  a 
	needless time when im watchi g tv and do cyou remember  
	the guy on pbs named bill nye  well,
	im getting high with him at the ritz and 
	hes blowing my mind while shes blowing these guys

	litterally come fuck me i need more drugs 
	so round up the kids like you give a fuck 
	figureatively cuz girl you know youre a slut
