Everything is energy. Keep in mind energy is just<br />
 a physics term for the most part. And keep in mind <br />
 that language, or at least verbal communication, <br />
 words/terms/phrases are just agreed upon, (or more just  programmed) sounds <br />
 that we basically coded and assigned certain values and meanings too, <br />
 or perhaps it was already programmed and reverse engeneered in a way, <br />
 simply by mimicking the natural sounds produced by a humans voice box, <br />
 face muscles, tongue, lips and mouth. But just picture this all from an energy stand point, <br />
 since everything is energy. And again, for now, <br />
 is just another word for describing something t<br />
 hat we only really know cannot be created or destroyed, <br />
 but more commonly assosiated with the state of an individual,<br />
 and there ability to perform at a higher capasity. <br />
 The word is also usually associated with the body, <br />
 and mind feeling tired and unable or the exact opposite.<br />
 I doubt many people think that when we refer to 'having energy'<br /> 
 e nature of reality more and how its a very fragile thing., <br />
 but for now lets focus on disecting that which cannot be skewed, <br />
 just misconstrued. Its the  enough to about something which<br />  
 by what ive concluded considering the following<br />
 by attatching values to different energy levels or forms of <br />
 energy/wavelengths/ frequencies that quickly decode them t<br />
 riggering a elecrical response that sends that information to the parts of ..<br />
Just started typin and didnt have anywhwere better to do it. <br />
Its just for me to look back on when i need ideas for rynesmind.com<br />
 or something lol. Plus i just wanna start writing<br />

You here sounds. Sound is vibration, <br />
vibration can because desvribed as frequencies, <br />
frequencies can then be described as numbers, and numbers or <br />
"values' can on be represented by shapes, shapes are forms, forms<br />
