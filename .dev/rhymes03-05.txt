		POINTless, 
    fortune favors 
    
    someday at my wake theyll remember my curs-ed name and
    loud visions impenitribuley enter their brains 
    only then will my impeccable greatness be
    resurected its too bad the 808s werent mixed 
    right we could understand him. 
    
    youll know it when we wake up into angels 
    
    i dont know how 
    you make it so easy to sound 
    as lame and impatient as anything around in the 80s
    
    Kno-1 rivals my beats 
    in fact the crowd pays me to make them.
    
    
    you can find me regularly 
	processing M.Cs into hostages
    
    as fast as you can
  
    please believe i got a croweded baesment
    full of passionless rappers tried to get them to come up but theyre too basic 
    acknowledgments go out to me for having dreams 
    and get accomplished youre lifes too sad to laugh at 
    honestly you about as dense as a black hole crushed by a trash compactor youre words are aimless and lack provacative syntax
    just imagine the ending directed by media anchors 
    or a maticulously crafted similie between your ears and you missed it.

        then fake it like 'my hand is broken'
        you wear a mask to hide the pain when
        thats the place you need to live 
        hurting yourself scraping your elbows running from monsters 
        after knowlege lights the room you see that all that its nonsence        
        digging
