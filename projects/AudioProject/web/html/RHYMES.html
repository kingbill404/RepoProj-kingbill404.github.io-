<h1>###### random ryan rhymes #######
<h2><pre>
	youre rhymes poorly chosen,
while mine was like, 
they was composed by 
a great god in the skys 
that i just opened.
# Ryline: #
we reach the apex and kept going 
while yall stumble,
we reproduce unlike same sex couples.
tooned in on the mike ya boy its ryan,
always crisp, but im fried.

	stumbling backwards, 
with a bottle of jack in my hand. 
roaming around just 
trying to stand being stuck in this strange land.
...	pummeling rappers.
i crack skulls in this rap game 
im humbling ametures and handing their asses 
back to em wraped in celephane.
i made that track.
now the mask is off,
now im being candid.
i'm taking acid, by the sheet. 
blasted off and never landed.
i keep it moving while you asleep 
steady camping.
keep the masses in awe
with my lyrical genius repatoir
dropping bombs on you sheeple
and i dont need no reason 
i tie my dreams into the sky 
and the morning breeze, best believe
 you have yet to see a god,

	i'm a warrior, 
amped up and going deep. [#ee]
my minds a little clever compared 
to your anaverage diety 
im a puppet but im pullling strings,
im seeing through a new eyes.
im about to be crowned your king.
but what youre seeing is (actually) 
the seed of the demon 
embedded inside of me.
..contractually.
its urban chi
cramin rhymes up in your head 
smokin these potent trees. 

freestyle shit top of the dome 
meanwhile these  
sheep sleepin back at home
crackin skulls 
packin bowls, in actuality
 im the master of reality
 attackin flows
 go like a speed boat, defeat the hopeleass
 i leave a wake of woke folks trippin alone on they matress.
i thought i told you im bat shit
crazy when im fillin in my mad libs 
strait blowing the lid off the cabinet 
im making all matter animate and 
im adamate about being above average at least

we taking far from calculated dosages,
we faded and most 'these kids couldn't cope wit this
when i take my stash out 
on the weekend i take most of it

###  Everyone Knows Bill Billions ### <br/>
</h1><pre>
everyone knows billy billions 
alive with the science 
a thousand years old i update myself when i climax 
my timing and brilliance both combined can, 
only be rivaled by zeus's bolts of thunder and lighning.

you know where i be, but you not sure i'm living at 
im at the ritz violating the rules, in fact 
they say he's so skilled and amazing, 
the more of them i moraly 
choose to break the more they want me back.  .. .. 
after the ashes burn down to the floor, 
find me leaving you bastards ass kissing for more
core to the center, of the human advnture i realised
that whores were the first thing our species  
sort of invented.

or see two can take up the room fast 
especiallyb if they aint using the mattress 
her eyes belie her fashion and tell when shes coming soon
Public display of love an pain 
will melt in the skies' till the end of my days  
and these mentions of fame and how rare it is 
to see its own face like two panes
reflecting its carelessness 
Keep me loving the way the disparagement keeps you insane 

 love and the pain in an endless display  

And this will be the end of my weakness

go FUCK yourself 
the reason your girl's misshapen ass left so angry
was the mitch bade emo version you showed her of your mixtape 
NObody underSTANDS constantly mentioned in  
in your hooks it's a common theme
I've got a mob of Tall blonds at the promenade they'll easily GO bra less
the REAsoning of asking Why Men LOVE HIRE ing OBjects is obvious 
the pro meat grading of yourself  U S D A choice rawdoggin for verification 
but only According to strangers and people you've known soley on facebook see
my people easily own anyone in a battle like were collenting war prisoners as slaves
my bbasement is full of rappers too basic to make a come up
yeah, patience but Will you ever be satisfied with loosing like this and being inveloped verbally
rhetoricle, see you're forced follow the ordinances wheather or not you know of them is trivial
they've been commanded to serve your carnal wants and desires
'cause what better way than to literally lull you to Sheep and you buy it
